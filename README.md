# Portfolio Website  

## Description  
This portfolio website showcases an interactive 3D experience:
- Users can click on three models that function as buttons, opening animated panels with corresponding information.
- Projects with hyperlinks have hoverable titles that redirect to where they're hosted.
- There are draggable meshes on the sides that can be picked up and dropped, featuring physics interactions with other meshes.
- The title includes an animation that reacts to mouse hover.

## Note  
**System Requirements**:   
The website is GPU intensive due to the 3D rendering, physics, and animations. If you are using a low-end computer, the website may not work as intended or could experience performance issues. For the best experience, I recommend running it on a machine with decent GPU capabilities.
